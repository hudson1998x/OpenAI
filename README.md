# OpenAI

Open AI is written in NodeJS. It uses NodeJS as the functionality is vast and allows for multi threaded processing. Something critical in this software. I aim to create a secure but fast AI library. This software is designed to work exceptionally over LAN (Local Area Network) with the use of sockets. I would eventually like to add in python support for data processing and PHP support for data processing. This system will be designed in a way that addition of functionality would be exceptionally quick.
